Chargify API wrapper for the Django framework
chargify

This is a Django wrapper for the Chargify API which requires pychargify (it actually includes it as I have made some alterations to include coupons).
It allows you to interface with the Chargify API by just creating and manipulating standard model objects.

Installation
Place this library on your python path
Add "chargify" to your installed apps
Modify the chargify_settings_config.py to include your Chargify info
sync your database
NAME it settings.py


Notes on django south:
If you use django south, this application is under migration control.
When you sync the database it will try and do an import from chargify for you to import existing information from Chargify.com.

Requirements
pychargify
django
south (optional)


Notes on webhook:

To use webhook, you need to:

1. include the chargify/urls.py or add your own urls.py entry to the ChargifyWebhookView view
   or a subclass of it.
2. point chargify to the webhook URL

There are a few extension points to insert your own business logic.

Hint: when doing webhook development on localhost, you should use localtunnel.com to debug webhooks
